# tic_tac_toe
Classic vanilla JS game of tic-tac-toe

It's yet another Tic Tac Toe game!

This one is made with only Javascript for the game mechanism, and basic CSS for the visuals.
The majority of the code is inspired by the https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Tic-Tac-Toe.

The whole process is explained in a step-by-step manner in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM&t=1663s

The original inspiration and the added options of entering the player names comes from: https://github.com/robhitt/tic-tac-toe-js

Planned additions:
- Automatically change the first player each round (X first, then in the following game O plays first, and so on...)
- Add a score tracker (currently there is no keeping score of the player wins)
